# Numerical_Methods_for_Comvex_Optimization
This is a repository collecting the codes for experiments based on some interesting numerical algorithm I learnt on Spring 2024 Advanced Topics in Numerical Analysis: Convex Optimization course. The algorithms include Newton's Methods, Gradient Methods, and ADMM.
